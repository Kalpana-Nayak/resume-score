## 📊 How It Works

1. User uploads one or more resumes in PDF format.
2. User enters a job description.
3. The application extracts text from each resume.
4. Text is cleaned using SpaCy NLP preprocessing.
5. TF-IDF converts resumes and job description into vectors.
6. Cosine Similarity calculates the match score.
7. Resumes are ranked from highest to lowest similarity.
